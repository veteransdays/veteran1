        <p>In 1953, Alvin J. King of Emporia, Kan., proposed changing the name of the <b>holiday</b> to <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>, to recognize veterans from all wars and conflicts.  The theme for <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> 2024 is &ldquo;A Legacy of Loyalty and Service&rdquo;, and this year&rsquo;s winning poster was designed by Myisha Godette, a retired, disabled Army Veteran from Queens, New York. Myisha&rsquo;s design was driven by a desire to represent all who have served.  Veterans Day, in the United States, national holiday (<b>November</b> <b>11</b>) honouring veterans of the armed forces and those killed in the country&rsquo;s wars.

The Uniform <b>Holiday</b> Bill (Public Law 90-363 (82 Stat. 250)) was signed on June 28, 1968, and was intended to ensure three-<b>day</b> weekends for Federal employees by celebrating four national <b>holidays</b> on Mondays: Washington&rsquo;s Birthday, Memorial <b>Day</b>, <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>, and Columbus <b>Day</b>.  Veterans Day occurs on <b>November</b> <b>11</b> every year in the United States in honor of the &ldquo;eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month&quot; of 1918 that signaled the end of World War I, known...  <b>Veterans Day</b> (originally known as Armistice <b>Day</b>) is a federal <b>holiday</b> in the United States observed annually on November 11, for honoring military <b>veterans</b> of the United States Armed Forces. </p>        <p>Veterans day parade lexington nc 2024. <a href="./951.html">Veterans day events rochester ny</a>. <a href="./595.html">2024 veterans day freebies</a>.
