        <h2><strong>When and why did veterans day become a holiday Veterans day means me essay</strong></h2>
        <p>For example, members of the armed services and <b>veterans</b> are asked to stand at attention and salute when their <b>flag</b> is passing in a parade or being hoisted or lowered; civilians should place their right hand over their hearts.  One of the most striking military <b>flag</b> customs is the &quot;half-masting&quot; procedure aboard navy ships. Unlike civilian protocols, where <b>flags</b> are simply raised halfway, naval tradition requires the <b>flag</b> to be first raised to full-staff (all the way up), then respectfully lowered to the half-staff position. This practice, known as &quot;two-block and ...  The flag should fly at half-staff <b>for</b> <b>30</b> <b>days</b> at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions after the death of the president or a former president.  Answer: The U.S. <b>flag</b> should first be hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. Before <b>lowering</b> for the <b>day</b>, it should be raised to the peak again.  <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is always observed officially on November 11, regardless of the day of the week on which it falls. The <b>Veterans</b> Day National Ceremony, like most ceremonies around the nation, is held on <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> itself.  If <b>you</b> display the <b>flag</b> at night, it should be adequately illuminated. <b>Do</b> Raise and <b>Lower</b> the <b>Flag</b> Correctly When raising the <b>flag</b>, it should be done briskly. When <b>lowering</b> it, the <b>flag</b> should be lowered ceremoniously and with respect. Never let the <b>flag</b> touch the ground.  Raise the <b>flag</b> briskly at sunrise and <b>lower</b> it ceremoniously at sunset. If you&#39;re experiencing inclement weather and you&#39;re displaying the <b>flag</b> outdoors, be sure the <b>flag</b> is all-weather. Display the <b>flag</b> freely on buildings, stationary flagstaffs and schoolhouses.  <b>Fully</b> <b>Lower</b> the <b>Flag</b>: Finally, lower the flag completely from the staff, concluding the period of observance. This structured approach to flying the American flag at half-staff ensures that the practice is conducted with the seriousness and respect it merits.  The American <b>flag</b> should only be displayed from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. If properly illuminated during the night hours, the <b>flag</b> may be displayed for 24 hours. When raising the <b>flag</b>, it should be done briskly. When <b>lowering</b>, it should be done ceremoniously. </p>        <p><a href="./165.html">Veterans day parade panama city fl</a>. Veterans day free warner robins.
