        <h2><strong>What is the difference between remembrance day and veterans day Why is armistice day called veterans day</strong></h2>
        <p>Like the blood spilled from thousands of soldiers, this <b>poppy</b> was red. The red corn <b>poppy</b> (Papaver rheoeas) was native to Europe and also was prominent in the Napoleonic Wars. &ldquo;In Flanders Field&rdquo; became an instant favorite all over the world. It was particularly popular in Canada and the United States.  The red <b>poppy</b> is a symbol of sacrifice in honor of the soldiers that served and died for our country. Learn more about the origin of the red poppy and how wearing it for Memorial Day reflects our support for all the brave men and women for that made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.  <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is coming and you may see people wearing red <b>poppies</b> in their lapels, pinned to their clothing or worked into jewelry. What do they mean?  Americans don&rsquo;t typically wear <b>poppies</b> on November 11 (<b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>), which honors all living <b>veterans</b>. Instead, they wear the symbolic red flower on Memorial <b>Day</b>&mdash;the last Monday in...  A remembrance <b>poppy</b> is an artificial flower worn in some countries to commemorate their military personnel who died in war. Remembrance poppies are produced by veterans &#39; associations, which exchange the poppies for charitable donations used to give financial, social and emotional support to members and veterans of the armed forces. [1]  The restoration of the observance of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> to November 11 not only preserves the historical significance of the date, but helps focus attention on the important purpose of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>: A celebration to honor America&rsquo;s <b>veterans</b> for their patriotism, love of country, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good.  The red <b>poppy</b> became synonymous with the fallen troops during the First World War &mdash; and has remained a symbol of their sacrifice ever since. But the <b>poppies</b> adopted this meaning because of the war poem &ldquo;In Flanders Field&rdquo; written by the Canadian Physician, Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae.  Why are red <b>poppies</b> worn on <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>, and where can I obtain them? The wearing of <b>poppies</b> in honor of America&rsquo;s war dead is traditionally done on Memorial <b>Day</b>, not <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>. The practice of wearing of <b>poppies</b> takes its origin from the poem In Flanders Fields, written in 1915 by John McCrae.  <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is a U.S. legal holiday dedicated to American <b>veterans</b> of all wars, and <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> 2024 will occur on Monday, November 11. </p>        <p><a href="./497.html">Veterans day 2024 tribute</a>.
