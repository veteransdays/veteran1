        <h2><strong>Banks closed on veterans day Are banks closed the friday before veterans day</strong></h2>
        <p>Memorial <b>Day</b> is observed the last Monday of May each year, and is meant to honor all who served and gave their lives for their country. <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is in November, and honors all <b>veterans</b>, both ...  <b>November</b> <b>11</b> became Veterans Day, a day to honor American veterans of all wars. Over the years, however, there were some changes to the actual date that Veterans Day was observed.  <b>In</b> <b>1953</b>, Alvin J. King of Emporia, Kan., proposed changing the name of the holiday to Veterans Day, to recognize veterans from all wars and conflicts.  In 1968, Congress moved <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> to the fourth Monday in October. However, it became apparent that the <b>date</b> Nov. 11&mdash;the end of World War I&mdash;was historically significant to many Americans. As a result, Congress formally returned the observance of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> to its traditional <b>date</b> in 1978.  Veterans Day, in the United States, national holiday (<b>November</b> <b>11</b>) honoring veterans of the armed forces and those killed in the country&rsquo;s wars. The observance originated in 1919 on the first anniversary of the 1918 armistice that ended World War I and was known as Armistice Day.  Today, more than 1.1 million <b>veterans</b> and 11,000 survivors of deceased <b>veterans</b> are now receiving new service-connected disability benefits, and over 5.8 million <b>veterans</b> have been screened for ...  Although it was briefly changed to be celebrated on the fourth Monday of October in accordance with the Uniform Monday Holiday Act from 1971 until 1977, Veterans Day was permanently changed back to <b>November</b> <b>11</b> due to the historical significance of the day.  The Uniform Holiday Bill (Public Law 90-363 (82 Stat. 250)) was signed on <b>June</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1968</b>, and was intended to ensure three-day weekends for Federal employees by celebrating four national holidays on Mondays: Washington&rsquo;s Birthday, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Columbus Day.  At the urging of major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice <b>Day</b> was renamed <b>Veterans Day</b> in 1954. [4] <b>Veterans Day</b> is distinct from Memorial <b>Day</b>, a U.S. public holiday in May: <b>Veterans Day</b> commemorates the service of all U.S. <b>veterans</b>, while Memorial <b>Day</b> specifically honors those who have died while in military service.
