        <h2><strong>What was the original reason for veterans day Veterans day ruck</strong></h2>
        <p>Today we know taps as the solemn melody played by <b>buglers</b> at our military funerals. But that&#39;s not how the simple, 24-note tune got its start.  1:13. As the sun begins to set, the melancholy sound of a bugler playing &quot;<b>Taps</b>&quot; echoes off the old brick buildings on the town square in Martinsville, Indiana. A small crowd, mostly comprised of...  The final bugle call of the day on military installations, Taps is played at military bases as a signal to service members that it is <b>quiet</b> <b>time</b> or &ldquo;<b>lights</b> out&rdquo;. The time varies between branches and individual bases: either 21:00, 22:00, or 23:00 (9, 10, or 11pm).  <b>Taps</b> historian Jari Villanueva, a former ceremonial bugler at Arlington National Cemetery, discusses the evolution of the song and the meaning of Memorial <b>Day</b>.  <b>Taps</b> is a 24-note bugle call played at American military funerals, wreath-laying ceremonies, and memorial services like <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>. In 1862, Major General Daniel Adams Butterfield adopted a French bugle call believed to be written in 1809 to signify the <b>day</b>&rsquo;s end to soldiers.  The melody is both eloquent and haunting and the history of its origin is interesting and somewhat clouded in controversy and myth. The use of &ldquo;<b>Taps</b>&rdquo; is unique to the United States military, as the call is sounded at funerals, wreath-laying ceremonies and memorial services.  The mournful 24-note bugle tune &ldquo;<b>Taps</b>&rdquo; remains recognizable throughout America. The tune lasts about a minute. &ldquo;<b>Taps</b>&rdquo; crosses all ethnic, racial, religious, societal, and gender boundaries. Buglers <b>play</b> &ldquo;<b>Taps</b>&rdquo; at <b>veterans</b> funerals, memorials, and ceremonies, honoring those who served in America&rsquo;s armed forces.  Born of a French bugle call, the melody <b>we</b> know as &ldquo;<b>Taps</b>&rdquo; was rearranged and used during the Civil War as a call for lights out. In the late 1800s, the Army formally adopted the tune for use at military funerals and memorial services.  One of the most common traditions found on a military installation is the sound of bugles at three different times throughout the <b>day</b>. These calls are Reveille, Retreat and <b>Taps</b> and are meant to be reflective moments of respect and reverence for the American flag and the nation it represents. </p>        <p>What was the original reason for veterans day.
